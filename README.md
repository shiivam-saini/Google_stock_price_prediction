# Google Stock Price Prediction using RNN and LSTM

This project aims to predict the future stock prices of Google using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The models are trained on a dataset spanning five years of historical Google stock prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the models consists of daily stock prices of Google . The dataset contains the following columns:
- Date: The date of the stock price data
- Open: The opening price of the stock
- High: The highest price of the stock during the day
- Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day
- Close: The closing price of the stock
- Volume: The trading volume of the stock

## Project Structure

The project repository is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training the models.
- `models/`: Contains the trained RNN and LSTM models.
- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Contains the source code for loading the trained models and making predictions.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview of the project.


## Usage
